    <title>Inline Block</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Paragraph is a block element so it takes the whole width</p> <p>So, even if we write another paragraph on the same line it will be shifted to next line</p>
    <span>Istead if we use span</span> <span>it will remain on same line because span is inline tag</span>
    <strong>NB: This is also an inline tag</strong>
    <p>But as this is a block element it will change the line</p>
